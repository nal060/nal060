## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing research in NLP, machine learning, and the inner workings of transformer models. 

**Ongoing Projects:**

- Applying LLM interpretability techniques such as activation patching to study hallucinations in speech-based LLMs.
- Using deep learning architectures to predict reading proficiency from eye-tracking data. (vtnet-hai)
- Building multilingual detoxification models to reduce harmful LLM outputs. (text-detox)
- Contributing to `Moo4Feed`, an R package for animal welfare from feeding behavior. 
- Enhancing Korean and Indonesian parsing with morphosyntactic features via UniDive. (uni-dive)
